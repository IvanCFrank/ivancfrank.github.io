<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Dr. Ivan C. Frank</h1>
<p class="western">Dr. Ivan Frank is a veteran educator with more
than sixty years of teaching experience, both in the United States
and Israel. He lived on a kibbutz in Israel in the 1950s, later with
his family from 1968 to 1972 in the second urban collective in
Israeli history, and returned again to Israel from 1976 thru 1982.</p>
<p class="western">Dr. Ivan C. Frank is a noted American educator and
expert on high-risk youth. He has taught History, Philosophy, and
Education courses in high schools, colleges, universities, and youth
centers in the United States and Israel for over forty years. He was
a Fulbright Fellow in the summer of 1998, studying in Israel and
Jordan. Following that period of scholarship, he led workshops for
Social Studies teachers at the conventions of the National Council of
Social Studies on Israeli and Jordanian history, their peace
agreement, and their economic, social, and cultural relationships.</p>
<p class="western">He lived with his family in a kibbutz from 1977 to
1982, during which time he was coordinator of the Education
Department of the Regional College of the Negev and taught at Ben
Gurion University. He worked with high-risk youth in Pittsburgh from
1982 to 1990 as a teacher, coordinator of an alternative educational
program, psychometrist, and educational advocate.</p>
<p class="western">Ivan holds a Ph.D. in International Education from
the University of Pittsburgh, International Education Development
Program (IEDP), with special emphasis on educational and social
movements. While living in Israel, he wrote his dissertation on
at-risk children, returned to Pittsburgh to defend his research and
received his doctorate in 1981. He also holds a M.A. in Modern
European History (1972) and B.A. in Education (1963), with
undergraduate majors in History and Social Sciences from the
University of Pittsburgh. 
</p>
<p class="western">Dr. Frank has taught at Ben Gurion University and
the Regional College of the Negev, both in Israel. He has also worked
for the Histradrut in Israel, training African and Asian immigrants
in the development of labor and cooperative movements, and organized
educational development seminars on kibbutz life for Kibbutz Nachal
Oz. He has taught courses on Israeli history, Israeli current events,
and the development of socialism in Israel for the Osher Program at
the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. 
</p>
<p class="western">Dr. Frank has written nine books, five on the
nation of Israel, including his political memoir; two which address
kibbutz ideology and its relevance to the rehabilitation of at-risk
children; another analyzes the democratic socialist period of
1880-1935 (2011); and a fourth surveys modern Israeli history with a
view to the future (2008). His book, Children in Chaos (Praeger
Publishing, 1992) is included in the permanent collection of the
University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Library in New York City. 
</p>
<p class="western">Dr. Frank is a member of Ameinu (&quot;Our
People&quot;), a progressive Labor Zionist movement, and member of J
Street, the pre-eminent U.S.-based pro-Israel / pro-peace advocacy
group. He lives with his wife, Malke, in Pittsburgh.</p>
